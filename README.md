# Niles Voice Assistant (Python)
Python Voice Assistant


**General** <br>
I wanted to build my own personal assistant who starts the music or searches for something in the internet. I started with the first steps and researched for other great projects in this topic. 


**Getting Started** <br>
To start the project after cloning, you have to install several packages. 

- Spotify CLI (Mac only): https://www.npmjs.com/package/spotify-cli-mac
- Speech Recoginition: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/SpeechRecognition/
- OS: pip install os 

With the Spotify CLI you can control your local Spotify App on your Mac. The Speech Recognition package is important for getting the users text out of his voice. With OS you can control your computers terminal in your Python code. 

**Start the program** <br>
If you installed all the packages you can start the program with: <br>
`python niles.py`

**Important Note** <br>
This Python project is developed for german use only. You cannot say something in english. The program will not answer.


Have Fun! I will try to make this project better from week to week ... we will see
